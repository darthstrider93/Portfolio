### Regarding the Dataset
The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards by European cardholders.

This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

#### Introduction
We will use predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether a transaction is a normal payment or a fraud. As described in the dataset, the features are scaled and the names of the features are not shown due to privacy reasons. Nevertheless, we can still analyze some important aspects of the dataset

### AIM

* Understand the little distribution of the "little" data that was provided to us.
* Create a 50/50 sub-dataframe ratio of "Fraud" and "Non-Fraud" transactions
* Determine the Classifiers we are going to use and decide which one has a higher accuracy.

### Methodology
* Understanding our data
* Preprocessing
* Random UnderSampling
* Testing

**Gather Sense of Our Data**

The first thing we must do is gather a basic sense of our data. Remember, except for the transaction and amount we dont know what the other columns are (due to privacy reasons). The only thing we know, is that those columns that are unknown have been scaled already.

**Summary**

* The transaction amount is relatively small. The mean of all the mounts made is approximately USD 88.
* There are no "Null" values, so we don't have to work on ways to replace values.
* Most of the transactions were Non-Fraud (99.83%) of the time, while Fraud transactions occurs (017%) of the time in the dataframe.
