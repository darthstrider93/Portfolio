## Introduction
Starting out on with a career in Data Science is as exciting as it is scary, especially when you really don't have any concrete starting point other than vague ideas. Switching to a new career was a risky move on my side, but when Data came calling the onus fell on me to answer the call.

This project hopes to answer a few questions I had at the start of my journey.

I wanted to find out what regions of the world had the most demand for Data Scientists, leading to higher compensation, or pay. What would be the difference between working as a data analyst for a small, medium, or large firm, and how much do these affect your pay/growth?

This case study focuses on this, as we use data to come to accurate conclusions. Here we look into the top earners by job title across Data Science, and correlate it with company size, experience level, company location, etc.



**AIM**


Understand how Data Science roles are around the world.

Create a visual representation on factors that affect Data Science Roles.


**Methodology**
*  Understanding our data
*  Preprocessing
*  EDA
